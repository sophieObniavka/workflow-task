# Task on the Github Actions Topic

You have a **Java** application that utilizes **Maven** as the build system. The application relies on an environment variable called `APP_PORT` for running certain tests.

## The task is as follows:

- Create a file named `main.yml` that holds a **GitHub Actions** workflow named `CI Maven Project`.
- Configure the workflow to trigger on **push** and **pull request events**.
- Ensure that the workflow checks all tests using three different Java versions: 8, 11, and 17.
